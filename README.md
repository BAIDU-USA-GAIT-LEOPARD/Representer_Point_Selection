# Representer Point Selection for Explaining Deep Neural Networks

Code release for [Representer Point Selection for Explaining Deep Neural Networks](link.to.follow)


## Instructions

Before running any code run the following script:

```
mkdir data output; ln -s data influence-release-mod/scripts/data; ln -s output influence-release-mod/scripts/output
```

This will create symbolic links to two directories `data` and `output`, which will be used by the influence function code inside the `influence-release-mod` folder.

`data` directory will store data files such as training/test data, training/test features, etc. that is used to compute the influence function values / representer values.

data used: Link to be added.

`output` directory will store the computed influence function values /representer values.

output used: Link to be added.

Both directory contains information used by the notebooks in `experiments` folder, which can be used to replicate the figures in the paper.
