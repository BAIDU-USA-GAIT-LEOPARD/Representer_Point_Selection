This code is a modified version of [this repository](https://github.com/kohpangwei/influence-release) for Koh and Liang's paper:

> Pang Wei Koh and Percy Liang
>
> [Understanding Black-box Predictions via Influence Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04730)
>
> International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2017.

The main modifications made on top of the original version is extending the existing computation method to several different datasets, like Animals with Attributes, CIFAR-10, etc. to use as a baseline.

Here we omit the data and functions used in the original paper and just include the parts that are considered relevant to our work.
